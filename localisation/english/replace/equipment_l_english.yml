  medium_tank_assault_equipmentger_medium_tank_chassis_4_desc:0 "The Sturmpanzer IV was a heavy assault gun armed with a 15-cm-sIG StuH 43 L/12, developed in 1943. While the StuH 42 was an excellent assault gun, it did not have as high a firepower as it was sometimes needed. This vehicle did, pairing a devastating gun with very heavy armor to breach even the strongest fortifications. It was somewhat slow though."
