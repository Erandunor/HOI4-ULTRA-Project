    panzer_1_tank_chassis_desc:0 "The Panzerkampfwagen I was a light tank designed for training, armed with two MG13. Entering production in 1933, its armor was enough to stop small arms fire but its firepower was not suited for combat against tanks of any kind. Speed and reliability were excellent though, making the tank very suitable for the German Bewegungskrieg."
