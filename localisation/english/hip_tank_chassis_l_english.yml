    panzer_1_light_tank_chassis_desc:0 "The Panzerkampfwagen I was a light tank designed for training, armed with two MG13. Entering production in 1933, its armor was enough to stop small arms fire but its firepower was not suited for combat against tanks of any kind. Speed and reliability were excellent though, making the tank very suitable for the German Bewegungskrieg."

Going into production in 1937, it was basically an enlarged and improved 1936 Panzer I able to pierce other light tanks. It featured good speed and reliability, making it well suited for Bewegungskrieg against unprepared opponents. It was meant to be the main tank of the early Panzer-Divisions."

Quick, relatively lightly armed and armored the Panzer III was nonetheless an excellent vehicle setting the standard for optimal crew size for decades to come. With its 3-men-turret, intercom and radio system it allowed for superior coordination compared to other designs and coordinated high speed advances, the core of the German combined arms warfare."

    panzer_4_medium_tank_chassis_desc:0 "The Panzer IV H was a medium tank armed with a 7.5-cm-KwK 40 L/48. Since the G variant was still suffering from smaller Soviet anti-tank weapons, the Panzer IV H was outfitted with additional armored skirts, improving its survivability. Additionally the cannon barrel was lengthened somewhat to increase gun performance and the frontal armour significantly upgraded."
